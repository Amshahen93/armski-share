    description: `Kazbek is one of the highest and most beautiful and most visited mountains of Caucasus. It is located in the East part of Central Caucasus, on the border of Russian and Georgia. As Elbrus, Kazbek also is extinct volcano which is clearly appreciable from its conic form with distinctive remains of ancient gigantic crater on its south face. Technically Kazbek is not difficult for climbing although physically it is quite challenging as the height of the mountain is above 5000m. The Normal route is PD, mostly glacier walking, except the crux which is 100 m of easy ice climbing in the couloir below the summit (not steeper than 45 deg.) Kazbek is very popular mountain for climbing specially because of its simplicity and convenient access.`,
